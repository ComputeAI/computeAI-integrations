# ComputeAI

In this repo, we have provided a containerized deployment of the ComputeAI SQL engine.

ComputeAI containers work on most versions of Linux including Canonical Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, AmazonLinux 2.

Please note, this is just a single node containerized deployment. If you'd like to play with our elastic cluster, please email us at contact@compute.ai and we'd be happy to help.

## Quick Start

- [ComputeAI with Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations/tree/main/jupyter/README.md)
- [ComputeAI with Superset](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations/tree/main/superset/README.md)
- [ComputeAI with DBT](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations/tree/main/dbt/README.md)
- [ComputeAI with Airflow](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations/tree/main/airflow/README.md)
- [ComputeAI with MinIO](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations/tree/main/minio/README.md)
- [ComputeAI with HDFS](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations/tree/main/hdfs/README.md)

## ComputeAI in a nutshell

ComputeAI's creates immense value in the open Spark SQL ecosystem to create unlimited concurrency at [high performance](https://compute.ai/report/compute-vs-aws-emr-spark-benchmark-report/), reliability, and efficiency while reducing cloud infrastructure cost by ~5x.

Value prop:
- Massive concurrency with unlimited users/queries
- Extreme reliability (no OOM-kills)
- Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), hybrid, and on-premises
- High level of cloud security with enterprise grade SLAs
- 100% open standards (Parquet, Iceberg)
- Cluster up and running in less than a few minutes
- No touch, requires no management or tuning 

Simply download the container, develop using GBs of data, and run 1000s of concurrent jobs with TBs of data. There is no management or tuning needed. ComputeAI runs reliably and unattended like an OS.
